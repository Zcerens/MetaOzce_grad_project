# MetaOzce: Mobile Hotel Guide App


MetaOzce is a mobile application developed using Flutter. It operates with its own database supported by real data and assists users in hotel selection. Additionally, it allows users to manage hotels they've previously visited and marked as favorites. MetaOzce also suggests options similar to previously visited hotels and provides price estimates based on hotel features.

## Features

- Hotel listing: The application fetches hotels from a real-time database and presents them to users in a list.
- Favorite hotels: Users can mark hotels they've previously visited or liked as favorites and can manage this list.
- Similar hotel recommendations: MetaOzce suggests other hotels with similar features to those visited by the user.
- AI-based price recommendations: A Python code trained to make price estimates based on hotel features is used, providing users with hotel price recommendations.
